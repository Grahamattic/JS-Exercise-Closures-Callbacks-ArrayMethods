# Scope and Closure Challenge

The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## JavaScript Foundations

## Scope and Closures

## Objectives

- Explain function scope
- Describe what closure is, how closure is created in a program and why it is important to understand closures in JavaScript  

## Introduction

This challenge focuses on both scope and closures.

In this challenge you will be working to build a `scoreboard` (in the console) that takes randomly generated data and keeps track of a game's progress. If you're not familiar with the rules of baseball what you need to know is this: there are 9 innings and teams take turns "at-bat." Teams can only score while they are at bat. A team stops being at bat once they have gotten 3 `outs` by either striking out or through game play. You can read more about baseball rules [here](https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/baseball.html).

A scoreboard in a major league stadium looks something like this. In fact, the scoreboard at Fenway Park in Boston is actually quite famous.

There are layers upon layers of nested functions within the game of baseball. Your challenge today will be to work through tasks associated with these layers, and ultimately to produce a scoreboard that logs in the console.

## Instructions

### Task 1 - Set Up Project and Tests

1. Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github
2. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!)
3. `cd` into your newly cloned repository
4. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`
5. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual

### Task 2a - MVP code

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until your tests are passing.

### Task 2b - Written questions

Edit the `ReadMe` file with your answers.

1. In your own words, define closure (1-2 sentences).

        Closure is the combination of a function and the variables it uses within its scope (its lexical environment). It gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function.

2. Study the following code, then answer the questions below.

```js
function personalDice(name){
  return function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }
}

const dansRoll = personalDice("Dan");

const zoesRoll = personalDice("Zoe");


dansRoll();
dansRoll();
```

a. Where is closure used in this code? How can you tell?

        Closure is used in the anonymous function within the personalDice(name) function. I can tell because the function is enclosed in another function. Name is not defined inside of the anonymous function. The anonymous function has to reach outside of itself to find the value of name.

b. Compare and contrast calling `dansRoll` the first and second time. What is always the same? What could change?

        Name is always the same. The value of the dice roll (newRoll) changes since it is randomly defined.

c. What is the lexical scope of `newRoll`?

        The lexical scope of `newRoll` is the anonymous function that contains it. Since it is declared inside the anonymous funtion, it does not exist in the outer scope or the global scope.

### Task 3 - Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, **create** a new file called `stretch.js` and practice more with closures. There are no tests for these problems.

See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions

```js
(function(){
  var a = b = 3;
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));
```

        // My predicted output: "a defined? false" and "b defined? true"
        // Actual output: "a defined? false" and "b defined? true"

        // var a is undefined because when it is assigned the value of b, b has not yet been assigned a value.
        // Then, b is assigned the value of 3, which makes it defined when b is called.



2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).

```js
var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); // returns 16
addSix(21); // returns 27
```

        function createBase(base) {
            return function(add) {
                return base + add;
            }
        }

        var addSix = createBase(6);
        alert(addSix(10));
        alert(addSix(21));



3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!

        Object-oriented languages work well with a fixed set of operations on things. The existing classes are left alone and new classes are added which implement existing methods.Functional languages work well when you have a fixed set of things and primarily add new operations on existing things as your code evolves. The existing functions are untouched, and new functions are added that compute with existing data types.

        Some of the advantages of object-oriented programming include:

            1. Improved software-development productivity: Object-oriented programming is modular, as it provides separation of duties in object-based program development. It is also extensible, as objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors. Objects can also be reused within an across applications. Because of
            these three factors â€“ modularity, extensibility, and reusability â€“ object-oriented programming provides improved software-development productivity over traditional procedure-based programming techniques.

            2. Improved software maintainability: For the reasons mentioned above, objectoriented software is also easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes.
            
            3. Faster development: Reuse enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects.

            4. Lower cost of development: The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. Typically, more effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.

            5. Higher-quality software: Faster development of software and lower cost of development allows more time and resources to be used in the verification of the software. Although quality is dependent upon the experience of the teams, objectoriented programming tends to result in higher-quality software.
            
            
        Some of the disadvantages of object-oriented programming include:
            
            1. Steep learning curve: The thought process involved in object-oriented programming may not be natural for some people, and it can take time to get used to it. It is complex to create programs based on interaction of objects. Some of the key programming techniques, such as inheritance and polymorphism, can be challenging to comprehend initially.

            2. Larger program size: Object-oriented programs typically involve more lines of code than procedural programs.

            3. Slower programs: Object-oriented programs are typically slower than procedurebased programs, as they typically require more instructions to be executed.
            
            4. Not suitable for all types of problems: There are problems that lend themselves well to functional-programming style, logic-programming style, or procedure-based programming style, and applying object-oriented programming in those situations will not result in efficient programs. 

        Some of the pros of functional programming are:

            1. Using clean and transparent functions leads to reliable results without side effects that deliver and return exactly what you expect.
            
            2. It uses a more declarative style that focuses more on what needs to be done and less on how to do it, with an emphasis on efficiency and optimisation.

        Some of the cons of functional programming are: 
        
            1. It is a relatively new paradigm and sometimes it is not so easy to find documentation or information compared to Object-oriented Programming.
            
            2. Sometimes it may become illegible because of multiple large number of functions.
