# Scope and Closure Challenge

The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## JavaScript Foundations

## Scope and Closures

## Objectives

- Explain function scope
- Describe what closure is, how closure is created in a program and why it is important to understand closures in JavaScript  

## Introduction

This challenge focuses on both scope and closures.

In this challenge you will be working to build a `scoreboard` (in the console) that takes randomly generated data and keeps track of a game's progress. If you're not familiar with the rules of baseball what you need to know is this: there are 9 innings and teams take turns "at-bat." Teams can only score while they are at bat. A team stops being at bat once they have gotten 3 `outs` by either striking out or through game play. You can read more about baseball rules [here](https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/baseball.html).

A scoreboard in a major league stadium looks something like this. In fact, the scoreboard at Fenway Park in Boston is actually quite famous.

There are layers upon layers of nested functions within the game of baseball. Your challenge today will be to work through tasks associated with these layers, and ultimately to produce a scoreboard that logs in the console.

## Instructions

### Task 1 - Set Up Project and Tests

1. Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github
2. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!)
3. `cd` into your newly cloned repository
4. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`
5. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual

### Task 2a - MVP code

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until your tests are passing.

### Task 2b - Written questions

Edit the `ReadMe` file with your answers.

1. In your own words, define closure (1-2 sentences).

        Closure is the combination of a function and the variables it uses within its scope (its lexical environment). It gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function.

2. Study the following code, then answer the questions below.

```js
function personalDice(name){
  return function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }
}

const dansRoll = personalDice("Dan");

const zoesRoll = personalDice("Zoe");


dansRoll();
dansRoll();
```

a. Where is closure used in this code? How can you tell?

        Closure is used in the anonymous function within the personalDice(name) function. I can tell because the function is enclosed in another function. Name is not defined inside of the anonymous function. The anonymous function has to reach outside of itself to find the value of name.

b. Compare and contrast calling `dansRoll` the first and second time. What is always the same? What could change?

        Name is always the same. The value of the dice roll (newRoll) changes since it is randomly defined.

c. What is the lexical scope of `newRoll`?

        The lexical scope of `newRoll` is the anonymous function that contains it. Since it is declared inside the anonymous funtion, it does not exist in the outer scope or the global scope.

### Task 3 - Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, **create** a new file called `stretch.js` and practice more with closures. There are no tests for these problems.

See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions

```js
(function(){
  var a = b = 3;
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));
```

        // My predicted output: "a defined? false" and "b defined? true"
        // Actual output: "a defined? false" and "b defined? true"

        // var a is undefined because when it is assigned the value of b, b has not yet been assigned a value.
        // Then, b is assigned the value of 3, which makes it defined when b is called.



2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).

```js
var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); // returns 16
addSix(21); // returns 27
```

        function createBase(base) {
            return function(add) {
                return base + add;
            }
        }

        var addSix = createBase(6);
        alert(addSix(10));
        alert(addSix(21));



3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!

        Object-oriented languages work well with a fixed set of operations on things. The existing classes are left alone and new classes are added which implement existing methods.Functional languages work well when you have a fixed set of things and primarily add new operations on existing things as your code evolves. The existing functions are untouched, and new functions are added that compute with existing data types.

        Here is a breakdown of the differences between functional and object oriented programming:

            Functional Programming                                    Object Oriented Programming
            Definition: focuses on function evaluation                Definition: focuses on the concept of objects
            Data: uses immutable data                                 Date: uses the mutable data
            Model: Follows a declarative programming model            Model: Follows an imperative programming model
            Support: Supports parallel programming                    Support: Does not support parallel programming
            Execution: Statements can be excluded in any order        Execution: Statements executed in particular order
            Iteration: Uses recursion                                 Iteration: Uses loops
            Basic element: Functions & variables                      Basic element: Objects & methods

        Some of the advantages of object-oriented programming include:

            1. OOP languages can offer improved software-development productivity because they are:
            
                a. Modular. They povide separation of duties in object-based program development.
                   Part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes.

                b. Extensible. Objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors.

                c. Reusable. OOP languages provide rich object libraries and reusable code resources.
                   Objects can be reused within and across applications. This provides faster development processes.
                   The reuse of software also lowers development cost.

            2. OOP languages also provide improved software maintainability because of the reasons presented above.

            4. Typically, OOP analysis and design is frontloaded with more time and effort, which lowers the overall cost of development.

            5. Faster development and lower development costs lead to higher quality software, allowing more time and resources to be used in software verification. Although quality is usually dependent upon the experience of the deveopment teams, object-oriented programming tends to result in higher-quality software even with less experienced developers.
            
            
        Some of the disadvantages of object-oriented programming include:
            
            1. Object-orinted programming (OOP) languages have a steep learning curve. The process of acquiring this knowledge is not always natural. Thus, learning an OOP language and its key techiniques (such as inheritance, polymorphism, closure, etc.) can be challenging and very time consuming for some people. 

            2. OOP languages typically require more coding than procedural programs.

            3. OOP programs sometimes run slower than functional programs that are procedure based, because OOP programs typically required more instructional executions.
            
            4. OOP programming may not suit all problem solutions. For example, some problems are more suited to functional-programming style, logic-programming style, or procedure-based programming style. Thus, applying an OOP languge in those situations is not efficient. 

        Some of the pros of functional programming are:

            1. If you implement dry, clean, transparent functions, you can achieve reliable results and avoid unwanted side effects. Your code can perform exactly the way you intended it.
            
            2. Functional programming implements a declarative style. It focuses primarily on what needs to be done as opposed to how to do it. It emphasizes efficiency and optimisation.

        Some of the cons of functional programming are: 
        
            1. It is a relatively new paradigm. Consequently, documentation or helpful information is sometimes difficult to locate.
            
            2. Sometimes it may become illegible because of multiple large number of functions.
